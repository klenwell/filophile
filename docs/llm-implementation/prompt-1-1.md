# Step 1.1: Initial Rails Setup with Docker

This document summarizes the initial setup of the Filophile Rails application with Docker.

## Steps Completed

### 1. Docker Configuration

Created Docker configuration files for development environment:

- `Dockerfile`: Sets up Ruby 3.2.2 environment with necessary system dependencies
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines services for:
  - `web`: Rails application service
  - `db`: PostgreSQL 14 service
- `entrypoint.sh`: Docker entrypoint script to handle Rails-specific startup tasks

### 2. Rails Application Setup

Created a new Rails 7.1.2 application with PostgreSQL database:

- Generated basic Rails application structure
- Configured database connection in `config/database.yml`
- Set up environment variables for database connection

### 3. Development Tools

Added and configured development gems in `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem "rspec-rails", "~> 6.0"
  gem "factory_bot_rails"
  gem "faker"
  gem "pry-rails"
end

group :development do
  gem "rubocop", require: false
  gem "rubocop-rails", require: false
  gem "rubocop-rspec", require: false
  gem "guard"
  gem "guard-rspec"
  gem "spring"
end

group :test do
  gem "capybara"
  gem "selenium-webdriver"
  gem "webdrivers"
  gem "shoulda-matchers"
  gem "database_cleaner-active_record"
end
```

### 4. Testing Setup

Configured RSpec and related testing tools:

- Generated RSpec configuration files
- Configured FactoryBot, DatabaseCleaner, and Shoulda Matchers in `rails_helper.rb`
- Created initial health check endpoint (incomplete)

## Current Status

- Basic Rails application with Docker configuration is set up
- Development and testing tools are installed and configured
- Database configuration is in place
- Health check endpoint implementation is pending due to CSRF/authentication issues

## Next Steps

1. Resolve health check endpoint issues
2. Set up initial models and database schema
3. Implement core application features

## Issues to Address

The health check endpoint test is currently failing with a 403 Forbidden error. This needs investigation to:
- Properly handle CSRF protection for API endpoints
- Configure proper authentication/authorization
- Ensure proper routing and controller inheritance
