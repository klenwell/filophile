You are an experienced Rails consultant. You have been contracted to assist me in designing and building a small website.

For the next step, your task is to draft a detailed, step-by-step plan for implementing this project. Once you have a solid plan, break it down into small, iterative milestones that build on each other. Then review these milestones and then go another round to break each into small actionable steps. Review the results and make sure that the steps are small enough to be implemented safely, but big enough to move the project forward. Iterate until you feel that the steps are right-sized for this project.

From here you will have the foundation to provide a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts and ends by wiring things together. There must be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. At the end of each step, a developer must be able to successfully run all existing and new specs for the project and see that they pass.

Make sure to separate each prompt section. Use markdown. Each prompt should be tagged as text using code tags. The goal is to output prompts, but context is important as well.

Please review the spec file pasted below and complete step 2 by generating the implementation.md document:
