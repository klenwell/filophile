Please implement the next milestone for the Filophile Rails app. Remember:

- It is running on Rails 7.
- It is a dockerized app. Rails commands should be run through Docker.
- Use the README and docs for context, especially the docs/llm-planning/spec.md doc.
- Consult the existing codebase as needed.
